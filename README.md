# Kaggler-ja Slack log gatheing system and viwer on GAE

I develop this tool to dump and view log in [Kaggler-ja slack](https://kaggler-ja.herokuapp.com/). 

This tool works on Google App Engine (GAE).

Maybe, you can use this on your slack with small change.

Our demo is here: https://kaggler-ja-slack-archive.appspot.com/
